## How to Deploy

Deploying TronScanner is streamlined with Docker and Google Cloud. Follow the steps below to deploy your instance:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Begin by cloning the TronScanner repository to your local machine.

   `git clone https://github.com/orlovt/TronScanner.git`

3. **Build the Docker Image:**  
   Utilize Docker's `buildx` command to build the image for the `linux/amd64` platform. This command also tags the image for Google Cloud's Container Registry.
  
   `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t gcr.io/tronscanner/tron_go . --load`

5. **Push the Image to Google Cloud's Container Registry:**  
   Once the image is built, push it to the Container Registry.
  
   `docker push gcr.io/yourproject_id/repo_name`

7. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run:**  
   With the image in the Container Registry, deploy TronScanner to Google Cloud Run. This command specifies the platform as managed, sets the region, and allows unauthenticated access.
  
   `gcloud run deploy tron-scanner --image gcr.io/yourproject_id/repo_name --platform managed --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated`

9. **Verify Deployment:**  
   After deployment, Google Cloud will provide a URL for your service. Visit this URL to ensure TronScanner is operational and all functionalities are intact.
